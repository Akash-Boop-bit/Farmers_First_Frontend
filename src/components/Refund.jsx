      <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        At Farmers First, we strive to ensure customer satisfaction by
        connecting you directly with farmers to purchase fresh produce. We
        understand that there may be circumstances in which you need to cancel a
        purchase, and we have outlined our refund policy below.
      </p>

      <h2>Cancellation and Refund Process</h2>
      <p>
        Customers are entitled to a full refund if they cancel their order
        before the product has been confirmed by the farmer. To initiate a
        cancellation, please contact us through our website's customer support
        portal or directly reach out to the farmer from whom you made the
        purchase.
      </p>

      <h2>Non-Refundable Conditions</h2>
      <p>
        Once a product has been confirmed by the farmer, meaning the order has
        been accepted and processing has begun, no refunds will be issued. This
        policy is in place to protect the interests of the farmers and to ensure
        that the products are delivered as promised.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Request a Refund</h2>
