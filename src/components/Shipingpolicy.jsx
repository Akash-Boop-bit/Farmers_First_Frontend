      <h1>Shipping Policy</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        At Farmers First, we are dedicated to providing a seamless experience
        where customers can purchase fresh produce directly from farmers. This
        Shipping Policy outlines how orders are processed, picked up, and the
        conditions under which refunds are issued.
      </p>

      <h2>Order Confirmation</h2>
      <p>
        Once an order is placed, the customer is required to visit the seller's
        (farmer’s) address to pick up the product. The pickup location and time
        will be communicated to the customer upon confirmation of the order.
        Please ensure that you have received a confirmation message before
        proceeding to the seller’s address.
      </p>

      <h2>Cancellation and Refund Process</h2>
      <p>
        Customers are entitled to a full refund if they cancel their order
        before the product has been confirmed by the farmer. If the order has
        been confirmed, meaning the farmer has accepted and begun preparing the
        order for pickup, no refunds will be issued.
      </p>

      <h2>Pickup Procedure</h2>
      <p>
        After receiving the confirmation, customers must go to the specified
        address at the agreed-upon time to collect their purchase. Farmers First
        is not responsible for delays or issues that arise if the customer fails
        to pick up the order at the designated time.
      </p>

      <h2>Non-Refundable Conditions</h2>
      <p>
        If the customer does not pick up the order after it has been confirmed
        and prepared by the farmer, no refunds will be issued. This policy helps
        ensure that farmers are compensated fairly for their efforts and that
        products do not go to waste.
      </p>
